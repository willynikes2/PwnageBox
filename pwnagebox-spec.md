## üß† Project Name
**PwnageBox: Autonomous AI Cybersecurity Platform**

## üìÖ Version
v1.0  
Date: July 18, 2025  
Author: Presient Labs

## üìå Executive Summary

PwnageBox is a plug-and-pwn AI-powered cybersecurity device designed to autonomously scan, exploit, and report on vulnerabilities in any target environment ‚Äî digital or human. It uses multiple radios (WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, SDR, etc.) to map and interact with the surrounding attack surface, then deploys three agentic AI modules:

- **Scammer**: Recon + device fingerprinting
- **Researcher**: Exploit reasoning + 0-day discovery
- **Pwner**: Goal-driven exploit executor

In Enterprise mode, the box is deployed by a field agent (technical or not) and left on-site. It autonomously performs its functions and emails a full vulnerability report to clients at the end of the day.

A dedicated **Social Engineering Module** augments attacks with AI-generated pretexts and voice cloning to test human-layer security and trust models.

## üéØ Product Goals

- Scan and exploit with no user input
- Work offline or sync with a cloud-based command hub
- Be deployable by non-technical field agents
- Enable red/blue team assessments, patching, or silent persistence
- Deliver clear reports to stakeholders automatically
- Include human-layer (social) testing via AI-generated attacks

## üß© Core System Modules

### 1. Scammer (Recon AI)
- Multi-radio scanning (WiFi, Zigbee, BLE, SDR)
- OS/service fingerprinting
- Firmware version and vendor mapping
- MAC signal tracking
- Output: Structured device fingerprint database

### 2. Researcher (Exploit Reasoning AI)
- Matches fingerprints to CVEs using Vulners/NVD/ExploitDB
- Ranks exploit probability
- Tags targets as patchable, vulnerable, or persistent candidates
- Contains Zero-Day Discovery Pipeline:
  - Decompilation (Ghidra, Binary Ninja, Cutter)
  - Static analysis (CodeQL + GPT)
  - Symbolic execution (angr)
  - Fuzzing (AFL++, Boofuzz)
  - GPT-guided exploit synthesis

### 3. Pwner (Agentic Exploit Engine)
- Executes chosen exploits via metasploit-style interface
- Selects execution goals: Patch, Persist, Report, or Observe
- Backdoor injection and credential theft
- Logs outcomes per target

---

## üó£Ô∏è 4. Social Engineering Module: `voicepwner`
- Voice cloning using LLM TTS models (ElevenLabs, Coqui, Bark)
- GPT-4o/Claude generates phone/email pretexts (CEO voice, fake IT calls, etc.)
- Voice playback scripts executed via phone, SIP, or Slack bot
- Logs response outcome, triggers, and trust levels

---

## üíª User Interaction

### Admin/Hacker
- Maintains exploit DB
- Pushes updates to boxes via Git or REST API
- Monitors device syncs and activation

### Field Agent
- Plugs in box (WiFi auto-connect or fallback AP mode)
- No CLI or setup required
- Reports auto-sent to client email or S3 bucket

### Client
- Receives encrypted report PDF or secure portal link
- Report includes summary, vulnerabilities, fixes, and human-layer test results
